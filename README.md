# Hangman-game
Project-->4

This is my fourth project where im testing my beginner javascript knowledge with a little bit of css and of course html5

The project theme is the "old-classic" game "Hangman" where you have to guess the secret word, but be carefull you have only 7 chances to guess it.
In this version you can play either against the computer or take your friend and play against him.
